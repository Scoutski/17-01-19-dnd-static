      <h1 class="title">Thursday, January 19, 2017</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>The party awoke in the Stonehill inn after thwarting the plans of a shapeshifting
        demon in the previous session. As they come down the stairs of the inn, they realise that
        they do not have any active goals and ponder what they should do next. The only remaining
        lead they had was a map (found in the direwolf's den to the south of town), but before
        they could discuss it, they were interrupted...</p>

      <p>Suddenly, a group of angry dwarves meet them at the door of the inn and accues them of
        freeing a murderer, namely the elf 'Haradeth'. It is true that Malveus and Finneus let
        him free after discovering he was a murderer, though they had reason to believe he was
        not in control of his actions and that he was not lying. Returning to the conversation,
        the party was not swayed by the threats of the Dwarves to explain their actions. Once
        the threat of violence came up, they cowered back to their part of town.</p>

      <p>Without a clear goal in sight, the party did what any reasonable people with nothing
        to do would, they drank. Unfortunately they were distracted again by another group from
        town trying to dump their problems on the group, this time it was the Elves. Apparently,
        in retalliation to being ignored earlier in the day, the Dwarves had gone to take their
        vengeance out upon the homes of the Elves by burning them down. After Lucille negotiated
        for half of their stuff, the party agreed to go check out the commotion.</p>

      <p>It turned out however that the elves were a bunch of lying jerks too and that there
        was no fire. It seemed that the two groups were just looking for an opportunity to abuse
        the kindnesses that the group had shown in order to take out their rivals. Now, being fed
        up, Minethrye told them that if they tried this shit again, they'd be back to make them 
        pay. This comment caused the two groups turned sheepish and agreed to behave. Having settled
        them down, the party showed the groups their map and learned the location of an old mining
        cave a few miles out of town, with haste, they set off in search of loot.</p>

      <p>As the party approached the cave entrance from out of a nearby thicket and slowly skirted
        the entrance to see inside. As they approached, they managed to spot 6 small fiery demons.
        Determined to test out some of his new skills, Lucille cast fear (see appendix) on the group
        which caused a bit of a panic in the party. After a bit of arguing, the imps returned and a 
        fight ensued.</p>

          <div class="encounter-details">
            After being feared by Lucille, the imps returned to combat against the party. They didn't
            put up much of a fight and most of them were one-shot. Also during this fight, Minythrie
            managed to projectile diarrhea all over Finneus who managed to get a little bit in his
            mouth... At one point Gulmar was feared deeper into the cave where he snuck up on two
            braindead looking ogres, he returned to the group to finish the fight though.

      </div>

      <p>After the battle, the party headed down the first tunnel to the left. Faced with the two ogres
        guarding a cell of some kind, the group had time to discuss how to proceed. Lucille decided to 
        try engage the ogres...</p>

            In a quick conversation, Lucille learned that the two ogres, known as 'Bork' and
            'Birk' were working for someone called 'Rancid Betty'. Persuading the ogres that they
            were here to help them, He got them to break open the prison cell and then after learning
            'that Bork and Birk best friends', that they should go have a nap somewhere else.

      </div>

      <p>After getting rid of the guards, the party entered the cell to find Haradeth, the Elf who
        Malveus and Finneus had freed. He explained that he had tried to leave town but was drawn to
        this place and after regaining his senses, he found himself locked in this cage. He thanked
        them again and gave the party 20x silver tipped arrows which were then distributed to Minethrye
        and Finneus. They decided they would come back for him after they had finished exploring the
        cave and they left him to go explore further.

      <p>Heading deeper into the cave, they come across another mined out tunnel which just so 
        happens to lead to another 2 ogres standing guard. Immediately the party stepped up to
        try talk to these two and avoid an unnecessary fight:

            Another conversation with two dim-witted ogres had them easily sent off
            at the party's whim. This time it was Malveus and Lucille who convinced 
            them to head off to look after Haradeth.

      <p>As the group heads past the area these two ogres were guarding, they manage to hear
        some horse-like noises coming from the other side of a large wooden door. When they 
        open it up, they are confronted with a dark-horse with a fiery mane and a tall human-like
        figure draped in robes on top of a large stone altar. Before they had time to react,
        the horse bucked and charged at the door, where Gulmar was ready to meet it head on.</p>

            The demon's life was short-lived and ended in a savage blow from Gulmar's mace. The
            mace hit it with such force that it's fiery insides managed to enchant his mace.

      </div>

      <p>Without any time to consider their defeated opponent, the group redirected their attacks
        to the figure standing atop the pedestal. Malveus launched a fiery attack that managed to
        burn away part of the robes shrouding the mysterious figure. The attack revealed a charred
        black skin underneath and something not of the mortal races. Gulmar charged up to the
        platform to take a swing at the creature as the other asssaulted from range.</p>

      <p>On the creatures next attack, it managed to grab Gulmar and pull him into a different plane,
        to the rest of the party, the two of them disappeared from sight, leaving behind an ethereal
        smoke. One by one the group headed up to the platform and stepped into the mist, transporting
        them to the other plane.</p>

            At first it seemed that many of the attacks delivered by the group were ineffective
            but Minethyre remembered about the silver-tipped arrows given to her by Haradeth. She
            started by firing a precisely aimed shot right through her heart, and another one 
            through her upper body to take her down swiftly.

      </div>

      <p>After the creature collapsed to the ground, the party slowly phased back into the 
        material plane. Overjoyed with their victory, they went about searching for any loot
        and luckily Gulmar came upon it first:</p>

      <p>At this point, the party decapitated the witch and headed back to Haradeth's cell,
        where they had sent 'Bark' and 'Reginald' to look after the prisoner until they
        returned. When they arrived they had a short conversation to relieve the ogre's of
        their duty.</p>

      <p>Once the ogres are gone, the party approached Haradeth again to check on him,
        needless to say he was pretty confused when two more ogres came back in to guard
        his cell after the last two had been dispatched of. Lucille decided this would be
        a good time to wear the witch's head like a puppet (it wasn't a good time), disgusting
        Haradeth. They once again resolved to head back deeper into the mine to look for
        any extra treasures, vowing to return to take Haradeth back to town.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The last room they approached had two more fire imps bathing in a strange looking pool
        with a human skeleton resting on a small island in the middle. Catching the party's eyes
        was the skeletons backpack which looked to contain additional goods. Before they could
        get to that however, they had to make quick work of the imps.

          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>The only thing left to do now was to get to the skeleton in the middle. Finneus tried
        to jump and swim over to the island but was met with a strong burning pain and immediately
        hopped out of the liquid. Gulmar on the other hand decided to exercise his acrobat abilities
        and jump over to the pool which he did successfully. Unfortunately without the ability to
        get a solid run up, jumping back would be much harder. In order to preserve the goods
        however, he threw the backpack back to shore and then made his best effort of jumping
        across. The difficulty was clear when he landed back in the acid taking some damage, only
        to be roped out by Minethrye a few moments later.</p>

      <p>While Gulmar was trying to get back to shore, Lucille rushed to the bag to take a look at
        the contents and managed to find:</p>

          An invisible cone of terror causes each living creature in the area to become panicked
          unless it succeeds on a Will save. If cornered, a panicked creature begins cowering. If
