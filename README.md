# D&D Blog (Static)

This repo contains the D&D blog for the campaign run by my friends and I. Although I want to work
on a fully dynamic editor that stores information in a database, in the interest of getting content
out to the players in our campaign, I will start by creating the blog in a static space first. The
plan will just be to host it on github pages or another static frontend site.
