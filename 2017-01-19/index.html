    <div class="content">
      <p>The party awoke in the Stonehill inn after thwarting the plans of a shapeshifting
        demon in the previous session. As they come down the stairs of the inn, they realise that
        they do not have any active goals and ponder what they should do next. The only remaining
        lead they had was a map (found in the direwolf's den to the south of town), but before
        they could discuss it, they were interrupted...</p>

      <p>Suddenly, a group of angry dwarves meet them at the door of the inn and accues them of
        freeing a murderer, namely the elf 'Haradeth'. It is true that Malveus and Finneus let
        him free after discovering he was a murderer, though they had reason to believe he was
        not in control of his actions and that he was not lying. Returning to the conversation,
        the party was not swayed by the threats of the Dwarves to explain their actions. Once
        the threat of violence came up, they cowered back to their part of town.</p>

      <p>Without a clear goal in sight, the party did what any reasonable people with nothing
        to do would, they drank. Unfortunately they were distracted again by another group from
        town trying to dump their problems on the group, this time it was the Elves. Apparently,
        in retalliation to being ignored earlier in the day, the Dwarves had gone to take their
        vengeance out upon the homes of the Elves by burning them down. After Lucille negotiated
        for half of their stuff, the party agreed to go check out the commotion.</p>

      <p>It turned out however that the elves were a bunch of lying jerks too and that there
        was no fire. It seemed that the two groups were just looking for an opportunity to abuse
        the kindnesses that the group had shown in order to take out their rivals. Now, being fed
        up, Minethrye told them that if they tried this shit again, they'd be back to make them 
        pay. This comment caused the two groups turned sheepish and agreed to behave. Having settled
        them down, the party showed the groups their map and learned the location of an old mining
        cave a few miles out of town, with haste, they set off in search of loot.</p>

      <p>As the party approached the cave entrance from out of a nearby thicket and slowly skirted
        the entrance to see inside. As they approached, they managed to spot 6 small fiery demons.
        Determined to test out some of his new skills, Lucille cast fear (see appendix) on the group
        which caused a bit of a panic in the party. After a bit of arguing, the imps returned and a 
        fight ensued.

            After being feared by Lucille, the imps returned to combat against the party. They didn't
            put up much of a fight and most of them were one-shot. Also during this fight, Minythrie
            managed to projectile diarrhea all over Finneus who managed to get a little bit in his
            mouth... At one point Gulmar was feared deeper into the cave where he snuck up on two
            braindead looking ogres, he returned to the group to finish the fight though.

      The group are faced with two more braindead ogres that have not noticed them. At the back of the room the group notice a room that’s like a prison cell.

      Malveus approaches Harrideth.
      H “Did you bring everyone to save m-”
      Ma “Didnt you leave town?”
      H “I tried to leave but i was captured”
      He no longer has the mind control aura.
      Ma“What is it they want from you”

      They travel to the next cave opening.

      Ogre “HEY YOU WHAT YOU DO HERE”
      M:“Master sent me”
      Ogre “WHO MASTER”

      Reginald skips out of the room.
      Bark remains, looking braindead around the room.
      L: [To bark]“You should follow reginald”
      Bark looks around.
      “Okay”
      Bark leaves.

      Exp gained for ogres.

      Horse noises:
      They proceed to the next room:
      There is a raised altar - there is a large figure on the top, and around is a dark horse with a fiery mane.

      Malveus tells you all to go and fuck yourselves and sits down [simon left]
      Lucy’s ocarina now spits hot fire
      The large figure reaches out and grabs Gulmar.
      Gulmar enters a nightmare realm - the figure and Gulmar disappear out of the rest of the group’s sight.

      The figure Gross sloppy tits, not wearing much clothes.
      She takes a swipe and misses.

      Finneus burns himself on the horse.

      Minethrye walked up to the shadowy motherfucking thing - she enters the nightmare realm. Gulmar says hi. Minethrye cops a tit in the face.

      Minethrye has also disappeared.

      Gulmar tries to hit her, but it glances off the thick skin.
      He tries once more and hits - [rolls 14] it feels like hitting a rock, but you can see that to force is felt.

      Malveus goes into the shadow realm - right into the hags chest.

      The figure tries to hit Minethrye, and ends up gently caressing her head.

      Lucy walks up near the shadow realm and tries to play marvin gaye on his ocarina. They cannot hear it in the shadow realm

      Gulmar hits her in the tit “Owwww! ” and she grabs it.
      Finn enters the shadow realm.

      THe figure plants her hand on Finns head - he gains level 1 exhaustion - feels lethargic

      Minethryes hit the figure for 26 damage. Right into the heart. “SHOT THROUGH THE HEART, AND YOU’RE TO BLAME”
      “AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!” 
      Minethrye shoots again - does 74 damage in one turn
      “AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!”

      They find a small knapsackm and a leather hat. They also behead the witch and take the head.

      “You should put on the leather and become a leather daddy.”
      Sam: I put on the leather hat.
      It is a magic hat. 

      “Nothing about his appearance looks different”
      “Except his snazzy new hat.”

      Mi“Well, she’s a black witch”
      G“She’s definitiely black”
      Fi: “With eyes”
      L“What the fuck is a witch?”
      Ma: “I think it’s an imp”


      They head back to the prisoners room to find angry and confused.

      Re“Asshole mean word”

      Mi“We killed the witch”
      Re“You witch??”
      Mi“No this” [shows witch head]
      Re“You kill witch? You save reginald? ...You hero.”
      Re“We go home”
      L“No song?”
      Re“Song take time”

      Lucy gives red herring to Bark. He eats.

      Mi“Have a good day guys,”
      Re:“It night, it not day.”
      100exp charles gets double.

      Lucy wears the head like a puppet.
      H “You are a sad sad women”
      [Harrideth thought you were a woman]

      420 xp except charles who gets half.

      The group head to the last unexplored room.
      There appears to be two imps frolicking the the pool and a human looking skeleton with a backpack attached on an island in the middle

      Finneus hits an imp and kills it from range - as does Minethrye.

      Finneus tries to swim over to the pool - he feels acid immediately.

      Gulmar manages to land on the island. He throws the backpack back to the other side.
      He leaps forward and lands right into the acid. He takes 9 poison damage. [rolls 2] he cant get out straight away - 10 dmg.

      Lucy looks inside the backpack to find:
      350 silver, 40 gold, 1 blue quartz
      1 full set elegant clothes

      Minethrye throws down climbing equipment to get gulmar out, and they look at the loot.
